## Datasets
### Pittsburgh Police Arrests Data
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data
The Pittsburgh Police Arrests Data primarily focuses on arrests made between 2016 and 2023. I decided to analyze the number of arrests in each neighborhood. This information is crucial for assessing community safety, as neighborhoods with lower crime rates tend to be safer.
### Fire Incidents in City of Pittsburgh

The second dataset I utilized contains fire incident records from 2013 to the present. I focused on the number of fires in each neighborhood, regardless of the size or severity of the incidents. Fires pose a significant threat to quality of life and overall safety, making this data a vital component in evaluating general safety.
